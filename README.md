JavaScript and jQuery Projects
========================

My files from [a Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/projects-in-javascript-jquery/).

**JavaScript quiz** (Project 1) Lecture 3: JS basics. Lecture 4: Quiz, only radio buttons, no jQuery; answers in the JS file. [See it.](http://macloo.github.io/projects-javascript-jquery/JavaScript%20quiz/lecture4.html)

**jQuery content slider** (Project 2) Prev and Next buttons; setInterval() for auto-play. Pretty rigid. Not responsive. Two JS files: lecture9 is without auto-play and lecture9_b includes auto-play with both setInterval() and clearInterval(). [See it.](http://macloo.github.io/projects-javascript-jquery/jQuery%20content%20slider/lecture9.html)

**jQuery YouTube API search** (Project 3) This is kind of a nightmare. Lots of stuff shown and not explained in the tutorial. I made tons of comments in both my JS and my HTML. Got everything working. Learned a lot about how APIs work! [See it.](http://macloo.github.io/projects-javascript-jquery/jQuery%20YouTube%20API%20search/lecture12.html)

**jQuery accordion** (Project 4) An easy project, but with nice interaction thanks to "toggle." A typical show/hide FAQ design. [See it.](http://macloo.github.io/projects-javascript-jquery/jQuery%20accordion/lecture18.html)
